Llama Index is an open source project and it is a framework for creating LLM based applications. Main aim of Llama Index is to connect 
custom data resources with LLMs. 

Llama Index provides various functionalities like:
1. Prompt Template
2. Agent
3. Tools
4. Document Loader
5. Indexing
6. Sorting
7. Query
8. Evaluation

 Chain and memory functionalities are not available in Llama Index but these functionalities are supported by LangChain.
 But we can use llamaindex.langchain to access memory and chain components as well.

 Virtual Environment used: llamaindex.
 To activate the environment: conda activate "/Users/atharva7/Downloads/Llama Index/llamaindex".
